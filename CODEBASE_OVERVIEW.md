### Layered Architecture

```
Request → Route → (celebrate validation) → (auth middleware) → Controller → Service → Repository → MongoDB
```

## 🔐 Authentication

- **Mechanism:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header
- **Flow:**
  1. `POST /api/user` — Register (password bcrypt-hashed before storage)
  2. `POST /api/user/login` — Returns a signed JWT token (expires in **1 hour**)
  3. Protected routes use the `authenticate` middleware, which:
     - Strips `Bearer ` from the header
     - Verifies the JWT using `JWT_SECRET` env variable
     - Looks up the user in MongoDB by `_id`
     - Attaches `req.user` or returns `401 Unauthorized`

---

## 🗄️ Database Connectivity

- **Database:** MongoDB (connection URI from `process.env.MONGODB_URI`)
- **ODM:** Mongoose
- Connection is established once at startup via `connect()` in `utils/dbConnect.js`
- A `disconnect()` helper is available for test teardown

## 🌐 Frontend Consumption

The API is designed to be consumed by a **separate frontend SPA** (React/Angular/etc.):
- **CORS** is enabled globally (`app.use(cors())`), so any origin can call the API
- All API responses follow a uniform shape: `{ status: 200, data: {...}, message: "..." }`
- Errors are returned with HTTP status codes and a message string
- The frontend authenticates by storing the JWT and sending it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected routes
- The landing page (`GET /`) just serves a Pug "health-check" page ("All systems up and running")

---

## ⚠️ Notable Observations

1. **Consistent auth coverage** — All routes require authentication (`authenticate` middleware). Many mutating and sensitive read routes also enforce role-based access via `authorizeRoles`.
2. **Single Order model** — The separate `OrderNew` model has been removed. The `/api/orderNew` routes now use the normalized `Order` model (ObjectId refs for `manager` and `supplier`), matching the legacy `/api/order` routes. The "OrderNew" route prefix is retained for backward compatibility.
3. **JWT token expiry** — Tokens are signed with `expiresIn: "1h"` and require re-authentication after expiry.
4. **Request body size** — Allows up to 50MB (likely for base64 product images).
5. **Tests** are organized into `unit/`, `intergration/` (sic), and `functional/` directories.
